list of things todo. one day I might make this page pretty.

obstacles: 
- walk on obstacles? I've it set it up so that we have an obstacle object and so we have the groundwork to add functionality to bounce, slide, etc off obstacles.
- I painted it brown but it's ugly and so obstacles are definitely something we need to prettify- and prettifying it would also add a lot of creative elements to the game too I think.
